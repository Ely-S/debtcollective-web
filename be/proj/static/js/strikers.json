Not only did the school fail me, but the Department of Education failed me because it is their responsibility to make sure that these schools provide a quality education at an affordable cost at a scam-free school. I took out $40,000 in loans so that I could make a better life for my infant son. I earned a criminal justice degree that most employers do not even recognize. After college, I took a job as a housekeeper making barely over minimum wage. I am completely lost and in debt. The only solution is for the Department of Education to discharge my loan so I can start over. I deserve free tuition for the time I wasted. In fact, all student debtors should join together to demand debt cancellation and free education. We are not going to stop fighting until we win. That’s what this strike is about.",

Corinthian (Everest’s parent company) did a great job making me believe that they cared. I trusted them, and why not? Why would education fail me? Education is supposed to lead to the American Dream. I studied hard and did everything right. But Everest stole all my Federal funding. They stole money from me that I didn’t even have, money that I can’t - and won’t - pay back. These debts are illegitimate because I never should have been charged that much to attend school in the first place. A school that sold me a Dream that turned out to be a Nightmare. But the Department of Education refuses to cancel my loans. They are continuing to allow these schools to collect this money for a bogus degree. Who should have to pay for Corinthian’s crimes? Not me. We (the people) are the victims here. Why are we allowing this company to have mores right than we do? How about Wells Fargo, Corinthian’s largest investor? Wells Fargo is a billion dollar corporation that profited from poverty. They should have to pay to cancel all Corinthian loans and fund free college for everyone led into this student debt trap. Let's make sure they are held accountable!",

I want to know -- why is the Department of Education supporting a scam for-profit school instead of students? I am on strike because I deserve a full refund and a free education. I co-founded a group called the Everest Avengers where Corinthian students are planning a long-term battle against Corinthian and the Department of Ed. There are 40 million student debtors across the country. This is only the beginning. If we all join together, imagine how much power we would have to end student debt for good.",

I was the first person in my family to attend college. I wanted to make my family proud and be able to take care of my disabled father. I studied hard and earned a 4.0 grade point average at Everest. Today, however, I am unemployed and can't find a job. I believe that Everest defrauded me. I filled out a single FAFSA form, and they continually took out loans in my name without my knowledge. (The tuition at Everest was so high that I also had to take out private Genesis loans just to stay in school. Everest also tried to get my father to co-sign for even more loans, but I refused.) After graduation, I discovered that Everest took out as many as 13 loans in my name. I now owe $36,412. Now Corinthian is being sued for predatory lending. But the Department of Education has so far refused to cancel these debts. I am harassed by debt collectors on a regular basis. Corinthian and the investors who got rich off my Federal loans have suffered no consequences. Instead, the Department of Education is helping the company avoid punishment. I am on strike because the only way out of this debt is to join with others in my situation. I can't pay, and I won't pay. The Department of Education should cancel our debt and provide a quality, free education to everyone.",

We deserve to have all our debt erased and to get the quality education that we were promised. Furthermore, this education should be free! Many of us who attended Corinthian are in worse financial condition than before we started school. Corinthian and the investors who funded it should be paying our debts, and they should pay for us to get an education from a reputable college that is not-for-profit and that is regionally accredited. Corinthian officials and investors lined their pockets with our lifetime educational funding. Free quality education should be available to all people!",

In the end, Everest never provided the job placement assistance they promised. I was left with nothing but $40K in debt that I can't pay. It's time for all Corinthian students to take a stand and refuse to pay this unjust debt. Corinthian should be shutdown, and the Department of Education should cancel these loans. ",

Admissions officers at Everest promised that I would receive job placement. But after completing all my courses, the only help they gave me was to send me job ads that I could have found myself on Craigslist. After going $33,000 in debt, I was not able to officially graduate because I owed the school money. Still, I didn't give up. I moved to a new state to try and look for work in the Paralegal field. But I ended up worse off than I was before I went to Everest. My tax refund has been garnished by debt collectors for years. And my wages are now being garnished by a debt collection agency called Education Credit Management Corp. Later, I discovered that ECMC is the same company that is buying dozens of Everest Campuses. They way I see it, ECMC can't lose. They make money if I pay my loans, and they make money if I don't. The only people who lose are the students. The entire scam is supported by the Department of Education, which approved the sale of Corinthian to ECMC. I want to know why the Department thinks the same company who is garnishing my wages should be running schools. Instead of supporting predatory lenders, the Department of Education should cancel my debt and the debt of all Corinthian students. ",

Since my classes took place completely online, I was robbed of that opportunity. I never met a fellow student or teacher during my time as a student.
