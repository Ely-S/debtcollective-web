            <h2 class="underline">TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:</h2><br>
            <p>19 February, 2015</p><br>

             <h6 class="emphasis">Who are we? We are the first generation made poor by the business of education.</h6>

             <p> We are people living paycheck to paycheck, single mothers, and young people just starting out. We wanted an education because we were driven to learn and to achieve a better life for ourselves and for our families.
            </p>
            <p>
            We trusted that education would lead to a better life. And we trusted you to ensure that the education system in this country would do so. But Corinthian took advantage of our dreams and targeted us to make a profit. You let it happen, and now you cash in.
            </p>
            <h6>
            Each month you force us to make payments into an immoral system that profits from our aspirations.
            </h6>

            <p>We paid dearly for degrees that have led to unemployment or to jobs that don’t pay a living wage. We can’t and won't pay any longer.
            </p>

            <h6>Repayment plans presented as a helping hand simply aren’t good enough. The wrong done to us is deeper than that. We are not alone in this fight. </h6>

            <p>Corinthian’s predatory empire pushed hundreds of thousands into a debt trap. But even beyond for-profit schools, tens of millions of students are in more debt than they can ever repay. And you are the debt collector, with powers beyond a payday lender’s wildest dreams.
            </p>
            <h6>To the Department of Education and to the lenders, servicers, and guarantee agencies who have stolen our futures, we say: enough! Erase these loans.</h6>

            <p>
             To current and former college students across the country, we say: we stand with you to demand the end of a higher education system that profits from all our dreams. Join our fight.
            </p>
            <h6 id="likethestrike">
            We won’t pay. We are the Corinthian Fifteen.
