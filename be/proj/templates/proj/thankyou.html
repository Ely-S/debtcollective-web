        <h1>Fight Sallie Mae and Navient</h1>
        <p>Inspired by the Corinthian student debt strike? Imagine what we could build if everyone with Sallie Mae and Navient loans joined forces. Together, we can create leverage and power over Sallie Mae and Navient to lower interest rates, reduce principals, and even eliminate student debt. Join the Sallie Mae/Navient collective to start planning the next strike.</p>
